## Introducing Myself 👋🌱👩‍💻⛰️📊

Hello, I'm Ava! An aspiring data scientist passionate about connecting data, ecology, and climate.

I recently graduated from the University of Oregon with dual B.S. degrees in Environmental Science and Data Science. I enjoy fieldwork and sensor deployments as much as cleaning datasets, building models, and packaging results into accessible tools (Plotly Dash, RShiny, dashboards, web interfaces). I’m especially interested in applying reproducible, open-science approaches to problems in climate resilience, marine science, and sustainability.

## Projects 💻

Please refer to my repositiories to view some of my projects in python and R.

Breakdown: 
### [Thesis_25](https://github.com/awessel3/Thesis_25) - 2025 Undergraduate Research Honors Thesis 
Bayesian modeling of citizen-science (iNaturalist) observations to quantify phenological shifts across prairie species in the Willamette Valley–Puget Trough ecoregion. Includes data cleaning pipelines, hierarchical Bayesian models (R / brms), and reproducible analysis notebooks.
currently still in the works to make it publishing ready. 
- R, BRMS, ggplot2, tidyverse, version control, ...

### [OHW25](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw25_proj_datadashboard_llm) - OceanHackWeek2025 Marine Data Science Hack
(On OHW25 repo page) With my team we created an interactive chatbot interface to visualize oceanographic data and make exploratory analysis more conversational. The creation of this project was important to help made oceanographic datasets more discoverable and usable for non-specialist users through an approachable interface. In an attempt to expedite the exploration phase of data analysis. 
- Juptyer Notebook, Marimo, LLM (Large Language Models), Python, version control, ...

### [Bee Urbanization Mini Project](https://github.com/awessel3/Bee-Urbanization-BI410) 
Exploration of urbanization impacts on bee diversity and abundance using field-collected ecological data. Includes cleaning, visualization, and statistical testing workflows. Completed in Fall 2024. 
- R, BRMS, version control

### [Diez_Lab_Parks_Project](https://github.com/awessel3/Diez_Lab_Parks_Project) - Analysis / Data Cleaning Repo for Diez Lab Projects 
Repository for ecological data cleaning and exploratory analysis as part of my work in the Diez Lab at the University of Oregon. Focused on biodiversity datasets collected across urban parks.
- R, tidyverse, lme4, version control, ...

### [Past_projects](https://github.com/awessel3/Past_Projects/tree/main) - Repo for Past Projects 
Collection of earlier projects (pre-GitHub). Includes work in RShiny, Jupyter Notebook, and visualization workflows.

## Other Projects 📑
These projects live outside of github. 

### GIS City of Salem Walkability Report 
[GIS project Salem Parks Project](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22665421/Final_proj_GEOG482.pdf)
This project was completed in partnership with the City of Salem to explore ways to improve city walkability. The work continued beyond the course when I was invited to write the final report, which was published in June 2024.
The full report can be found [here](https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/items/caa9fdba-8605-4506-9b52-ab88405d726d)
- ArcGIS Pro

### Tableau Dashboard 
[Parks Project Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ava.wessel/viz/TermProject_17422437298510/Dashboard1)
This project was completed in data science visualizations course in Winter 2025. using biodiversity datasets from the Diez Lab Parks Project to highlight patterns and differences across sites.
